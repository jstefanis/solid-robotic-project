todo

parameters

4 alvar tags

tag_0 => tag at the end of the plateau
tag_1 => tag in front of the pickup table
tag_2 => tag at the opossite side of the pickup table
tag_3 => tag in front of place table

Steps

0 initialize parameters and launch python script by a .launch file (done)
1 set initial pose by code (done)
2 Launch amcl.launch by code
3 navigate at the center of the vibot plateau by using acml and a set of coordinates

3.5 --if there is conflict between alvar tags detection and amcl --stop amcl.launch by code )

4. check for the ar_tag at the end of the vibot_plateau (tag_0) if it can be detected

5. rotate 90 deg ccw to detect the ar tag in front of the pickup tavle (tag_1)

6. when both tags are detected publish a message that the robot is ready for visual servoing

7. stop and wait for a message that vs and pick-and-place operations have finished.

8. when this message is received, rotate the robot 180 degrees and detect the third alvar tag on the opossite
side of the pickup table.

9 if correctly detected move to its detection for n meters. (approximate the center of the plateau)

10 when arrived, rotate ccw for 90 degrees and detect the alvar tag at the end of the plateau

11 move in the direction of the alvar tag and stop.

12. rotate 90 deg cw and detect the final tag at the place table

13. publish a message that the turtlebot is ready for vs

14 print on the log "finish"
